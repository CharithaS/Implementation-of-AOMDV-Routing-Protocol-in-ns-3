# Implementation of AOMDV Routing Protocol in ns-3

## Course Code: CS821

## Assignment: #FP1

### Overview:

Ad hoc On-demand Multipath Distance Vector (AOMDV) Routing Protocol is a multipath version of AODV which computes multiple paths during route discovery. It is designed primarily for highly  dynamic ad hoc networks where link failures and route breaks occur frequently. It works either in node-disjoint mode or link-disjoint mode [1]. AOMDV is already implemented in ns-2 [2]. This repository contains the implementation of AOMDV in ns-3 [3].
